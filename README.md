The URL Support Checker API is a simple service that determines whether a URL is supported by the yt-dlp library. The yt-dlp library supports thousands of websites, each with its own regular expression (_VALID_URL) for validating URLs. This API helps you quickly check if a URL matches the supported website patterns.
